The issue arises when attempting to use Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener within a function that's called multiple times, such as during component re-renders in React.  Each call creates a new listener, leading to multiple executions of the callback function and potential race conditions. This can manifest as unexpected behavior, such as the authentication status updating multiple times or UI elements flashing inconsistently.
