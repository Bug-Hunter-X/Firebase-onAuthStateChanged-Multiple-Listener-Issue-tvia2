# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Multiple Listener Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener within components that re-render frequently.  The bug involves creating multiple listeners, leading to unexpected behavior and potential race conditions. The solution provides a way to manage the listener using an effect hook (React) or similar mechanism to maintain a single active listener.

## Bug
The `authListenerBug.js` file shows an implementation where `onAuthStateChanged` is added repeatedly. This leads to race conditions and multiple updates, causing unpredictable behavior.

## Solution
The `authListenerSolution.js` file showcases the correct implementation using an effect hook in React (or a comparable method in other frameworks).  It ensures that only one listener is attached, preventing multiple updates and resolving the race conditions.
